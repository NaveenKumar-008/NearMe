                The Tirusulam Railway Station is one of the railway stations of the Chennai Beachâ€“Chengalpattu section of the Chennai Suburban Railway Network. 
                It serves the neighbourhood of Tirusulam, a suburb of Chennai where the city's airport is located. 
                It is located at a distance of 21 km (13 mi) from Chennai Beach terminus and is situated on the GST Road across the airport, with an elevation of 20 m (66 ft) above sea level.
                The station has two suburban platforms and another island platform for long-distance mainline trains.
                Since mainline trains do not halt at the station, the island platform remains unused. 
                The platform is 280 m long and has been considered to be extended to 575 m as there are plans to halt long-distance trains at the station.
